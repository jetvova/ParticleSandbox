# ParticleSandbox
Utilizes the PyGame library to simulate and visualize on-screen the trajectories of a given number of entities, with a certain radius, placed in randomized locations, accounting for the distance and mass of each in relation to one another when calculating gravitational attraction.

## Features
* GUI control panel activated with backslash
* Zooming and panning using keyboard controls
* Toggleable heatmap visualizing the change in gravity in relation to the position of the particles
* Simplistic model of particle fusion and corresponding release of energy
* Adjustable timescale
